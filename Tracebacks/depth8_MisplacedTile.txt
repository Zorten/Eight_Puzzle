Hello there, welcome to my 8-Puzzle Solver.
If you want to use a preset puzzle, enter '1'. If instead you want to create your own, enter '2'.
Choose a difficulty for your puzzle. Difficulty ranges from 1-8, with 1 being the easiest and 8 the hardest.
You chose 'Easy' difficulty
Choose algorithm to solve puzzle. 
 (1): Uniform Cost Search 
 (2): A* with Misplaced Tile Heuristic 
 (3): A* with Manhattan Distance Heuristic 
You chose to solve the puzzle with the A* algorithm and the Misplaced Tile heuristic
